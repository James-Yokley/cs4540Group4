**Team Collaboration for Accessibility Extension**
 
Team Members:
    James Yokley
    Alexander(AJ) Voisan
    Pokuong(Chris) Lao
    Hein Htet
 
Goal: Provide insight into your collaborative work as a team
 
Our team consists of three members who will be working with each other for the first time. For all members, this is the first web extension we will be developing for Mozilla Firefox or any browser. As computer science students we have shared experience with school related projects, but our knowledge of web and web extension development vary.
 
James Yokley has experience building projects and web applications in JavaScript. He is also comfortable with designing and implementing various projects from inception to production. James is accustomed to working in team settings for project development. James is currently working part-time in addition to full time school which limits options for meeting times.
 
Pokuong(Chris) Lau has experience with dynamic web development using Java Servlets and JSP, but limited experience with JavaScript. Pokuong currently has a time schedule with few restraints, allowing ample time to devote to our project. He is a team player that works well under pressure and is hoping to use this opportunity to improve his skills with JavaScript and web-based development.
 
Alexander(AJ) Voisan also has experience with dynamic web development using Java Servlets and JSP, but has only recently begun to work with JavaScript. Some of his strengths are working with a team, organizing the team goals and creating strategies to achieve them. Alexander is very scrupulous and has strong analytical skills that are useful in debugging various projects. He plans to use this project to advance his front-end development skills and effective collaboration techniques.

Hein Htet has some experience with Python, Javascript and HTML, but needed some guidance to complete the work. I mostly have experience on the frontend rather than the backend. I also know how to do video editing and photoshop.
 
The initial idea behind our web extension was thrown around in the text chat of our group's Discord server. After agreeing to the idea of a web extension that provided visual alteration for assistance with color-blindness and dyslexia, we planned a meeting to flesh out the details. Our brainstorming meeting was conducted online via Discord on the evening of September 26. All three group members were in attendance.
 
The first part of our meeting was to decide the capabilities our web extension will provide, and to determine what components we can implement to assist in these disabilities. We decided that the main idea is a web extension that provides assistance for various visual/learning disabilities. It will consist of a component that alters fonts, text colors, background colors, and overall appearance to assist for users with dyslexia. A component that alters webpage colors and image colors for different types of color blindness. And an interface where users can enable and configure the settings depending on their specific disability. We then assigned action items among ourselves to complete the deliverables of phase 1.
 
Towards the end of our meeting, we discussed the logistics of our future meetings and determined that we will be meeting online via Discord. All team members have availability on Tuesdays at 6:00pm at a minimum, but meeting times can be changed as needed.
 
Due to the smaller size of the team, we agreed to share roles and divide responsibilities as they arise. Our team dynamic also allows us to make decisions based on consensus of all team members.
 
Because our project development is going to be online, we believe that github will be the best form to collaborate on the web extension. We will be using the github repository located at:
